# Chess-AI-with-Pruning
## Welcome to my chess AI!
* This AI uses Minimax Recursion, Negamax and Alpha Beta Pruning to determine the next best possible move
* Be sure to adjust the search depth - increasing it will improve the move's score, however at the cost of computational time.
* You can also get two AI's to play eachother!
